            <p>Good evening teachers, fellow students and everyone present here.</p>
            <p>About four years ago, I sat here to be welcomed into this great institution. Well, we are all coming from diffferent places with different way of life to an institution with has their own style of rules desgined to accommodate all of us.</p>
            <p>Get all the fun of this university; enjoy each activity that is held in the university. Make yourself at ease here and never forget you can d oall the things that you want, but yet not all the things are good for you, even more dont't forget you are here as a student. </p>
            <p>Look around and see ! You are in India, one of the most growing countries  in the world. And you are the PART of it. See and seek the opportunities then make the maximum advantage of it. We value and respect your various traditions and cultures. But you are in India, learn to respect the culture and their way of life. For it's said "when you in Rome do what the Romans do". Eat the food if you can, learn the tradition if you can, but most importantly I urge you to learn the language by all means. For I tell you today is at your doorstep in your country and your only key to that is the language.</p>
            <p>The teachers and seniors are here to help you, in any of your enquiry, so don't bother. Make the good use of it!</p>
            <p>Not all of you might finish in th fourth year studies. This is basically due to your way of life. Choose the one that is good for you, and I wish you well</p>
            <p>Finally remember to make the school passes through you and dont't just pass through your school. For many people pass through the school everyday, they are the cooks, the drivers, the cleaners and many more. But if the school passes through you, you stand out to be the engineer, the economist or whatever course that the school taught you.</p>
            <p>Your future with this institution is in your hands, so now make it how you want it. Thank you people,  enjoy the show and Welcome to your university</p>
